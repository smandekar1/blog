After going through this lengthy tutorial, I was able to get a working shopping cart going on my Django site.  You can now add products to the site and then add them to your shopping cart even if you are not logged in.  After you login, your items are there for you to purchase.  Some things that can be added in the future would be a payment processing page with functionality.  Since I am not planning on taking anything live here, the project will probably be paused here unless there is some reason to build additional functionality.  The experience was fun, I would definitely do it again.  Here's how it looks so far with the bootstrap.
