For, the past several days, I had been looking if there was a way to enter open interest data for Futures in the the Quantopian platform to play around with it.  From the the docs, there isn't a way to do this.  The Quantopian sandbox is fairly contained.  You can't bring your own toys into it.  So it looks like I will have to go outside of Quantopian and see what can be done.  The goal of this project is to compare open interest data over time and see if there are factors that contribute to the interest being higher or lower.
