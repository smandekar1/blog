# Summary

The WordCloud library allows users to create generated word clouds as seen above.  This particular cloud was generated by searching for **"Tom Brady"** in tweets tweeted **during the Superbowl game** itself.  Using the **Twitter-API**, content creaters can create a custom search that show which aspects of a story are the most pertinent.  Tweets are searched by topic or search term and tweets with a minimum number of likes (favorite_count) are included in the search results.  This allows content creaters to quickly understand what topics audience members are most interested in at the time.  The WordCloud library also allows users to fit words into a graphical outline image (above).  

# Using WordCloud Graphic Images 
The outline image is generated automatically from an uploaded image.  To create an effective word cloud, it is best to use an image that has a strong border around it.  If there is not a strong border between the image and the background, words can “leak out” into the rest of the page.  Included here as another example using Alice in Wonderland as a background image.

# Other Notes
Even with tools like Stopwords, a good amount of old fashion editing was still required.  Spanish words krept in to the list and those needed to be taken out or added to the stopwords list.  I chose to remove curse words from the wordcloud, but other users may find those four letter words very relevant to the story.
