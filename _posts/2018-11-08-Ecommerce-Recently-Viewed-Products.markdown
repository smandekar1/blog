For the past fiew days, I've been looking at how to add recently viewed products to the customers product pages.  This seems to bee currently working so that the customer will see the past four or five products that they've viewed.  This may encourage them to go back to the products and buy them.  So far in Django, I've been working with function based views and class based views.  The class based views have been generic and I was able to find a way to pass other variables into a generic class based views.  Currently the only things being passed from the item that was viewed is the slug, and that's what needs to be fixed going forward.
